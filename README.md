### Building daily news pipeline in Fabric
This project automates the process of collecting and analyzing the latest news using the Bing Web Search API and Microsoft Fabric. The goal is to gather fresh news daily, perform sentiment analysis on news articles, and display the results in a Power BI dashboard. The pipeline is built using Microsoft Fabric components, including Data Factory, Lakehouse, Jupyter Notebooks, and Power BI, ensuring smooth orchestration, processing, and visualization of news data. Alerts are configured to notify when new data is available, allowing for timely reviews.
