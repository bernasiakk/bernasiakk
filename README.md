### Building daily news pipeline in Fabric
This project automates the process of collecting and analyzing the latest news using the Bing Web Search API and Microsoft Fabric. The goal is to gather fresh news daily, perform sentiment analysis on news articles, and display the results in a Power BI dashboard. The pipeline is built using Microsoft Fabric components, including Data Factory, Lakehouse, Jupyter Notebooks, and Power BI, ensuring smooth orchestration, processing, and visualization of news data. Alerts are configured to notify when new data is available, allowing for timely reviews.

### Analyzing stackoverflow data with Azure Databricks
This project builds an end-to-end ETL pipeline using Azure Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI to process and analyze Stack Overflow data. Following the bronze-silver-gold lakehouse architecture, raw data is ingested, transformed, and merged into unified tables for easy querying and visualization. The pipeline is designed for scalability, allowing new data categories to be seamlessly integrated. Security and governance are managed through Azure Key Vault and RBAC.
