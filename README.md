## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I’m Szymon, a passionate data enthusiast on a journey to become a Data Engineer.

📚 Currently diving deep into cloud data platforms, ETL pipelines, and all things big data.

💻 On the side, I love tinkering with home automation projects to make life a bit smarter.

❤️ Happy husband, living and working in beautiful Warsaw.

Feel free to connect, collaborate, or chat about data, home automation, or anything tech-related!
